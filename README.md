## Setup

- Choose to run the application (1)locally with Ruby or (2)inside docker

## Local Setup

- Install ruby 3.0
- Chrome installation is required
- `bundle install`

### Local Test Execution

- `rspec spec`

## Docker Setup

```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d chrome
```

### Docker Test Execution

### Cleanup
```
docker-compose down
```

## Running outside of docker
- Comment out `CHROME_URL: http://chrome:4444/wd/hub`
- `bundle install`
- `INTEG_TEST_ENV=... bundle exec rspec`

## Sample Successful run
